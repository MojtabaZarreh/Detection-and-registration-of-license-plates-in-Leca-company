I implemented this project at Leca Company using computer vision to enhance the speed of registering and processing the departure of loaded vehicles. After a click by the supervisors, the deep learning model is activated and begins processing and identifying the license plates. Once a plate is recognized in a frame, an image of the plate is captured and saved. Finally, the saved plate image is converted into text, extracting the plate numbers and characters, which are then stored in the company's database and displayed to the supervisors through the official company software.

I am also working on improving this system so that, with a single click, both the license plate and the vehicle's weight are simultaneously recorded in the company's software, eliminating the need for manual entry of the weight.
